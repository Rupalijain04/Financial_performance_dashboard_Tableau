# **ðŸ’° FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD**

## **1. Project Name**
- **Financial Performance Dashboard (Tableau)**

## **2. Business Problem & Goal**
- **Problem:** Leadership needed a consolidated, interactive view of financial metrics (Sales, Profit, COGS, Discounts) across multiple countries, products, and time periods. Without it, identifying underperforming regions/products and planning strategy was difficult.
- **Goal:** Build a Tableau dashboard that tracks key financial KPIs, highlights profitability drivers, and enables stakeholders to slice data dynamically by country, segment, product, and time.

## **3. My Role**
- Connected and imported the dataset into Tableau.
- Created calculated fields for Profit Margin, Total Discounts, Total Revenue, and Cost-to-Sales ratio.
- Designed and arranged multiple visualizations into an interactive dashboard with filters and slicers.
- Delivered a visually clean layout that decision-makers can use immediately.

## **4. Data**
- **Dataset Columns:** Segment, Country, Product, Discount Band, Units Sold, Manufacturing Price, Sale Price, Gross Sales, Discounts, Sales, COGS, Profit, Date, Month Number, Month Name, Year.
- **Source:** Public finance analytics dataset (link included in project).
- **Size:** Covers multiple countries, products, and several years of data.

## **5. Tools & Techniques**
- **Tools:** Tableau Desktop.
- **Techniques:**  
  - Data import and validation (date formats, numeric fields, category standardization).
  - Calculated fields (Profit Margin, Total Discounts, Total Revenue, COGS to Sales Ratio, Discount Impact).
  - Visualizations: Bar charts (Sales & Profit by Country), Line Graph (Sales & Profit Trend Over Time), Scatter Plot (Gross Sales vs Discounts), Heat Map (Sales by Product and Discount Band).
  - Interactive filters: Date, Segment, Country, Discount Band.

## **6. Process (Step-by-Step)**
- **Step 1:** Connect to the dataset in Tableau and validate data types (dates, numbers, categories).
- **Step 2:** Create calculated fields for Profit Margin, Total Discounts, Total Revenue, and Cost-to-Sales Ratio.
- **Step 3:** Build visualizations:
  - Sales & Profit by Country (bar chart).
  - Sales & Profit Trend Over Time (line graph).
  - Gross Sales vs Discounts (scatter plot).
  - Sales by Product and Discount Band (heat map).
- **Step 4:** Add filters for Date, Segment, Country, and Discount Band.
- **Step 5:** Assemble all sheets into a dashboard with a clean, professional layout and descriptive title.

## **7. Key Insights**
- **Country-level performance:** Bar chart reveals which countries drive the highest sales and profit.
- **Time trends:** Line graph highlights sales and profit trends by year/month for each segment.
- **Discount impact:** Scatter plot shows how discounts relate to gross sales, exposing over-discounted products.
- **Product & discount band:** Heat map shows which discount bands boost or hurt product sales.

## **8. Business Impact**
- Provided executives with a **single interactive view** of financial performance, reducing time spent on manual reporting.
- Enabled **data-driven decisions** about discount strategies and resource allocation by identifying which countries, products, and segments are most profitable.
- Supported **profit margin improvement** by showing cost-to-sales and discount impact side-by-side.
- Improved **forecasting and planning** by visualizing trends across multiple time periods.

## **9. Obstacles & Learnings**
- **Obstacle:** Dataset contained multiple time fields and inconsistent category labels requiring careful validation.
- **Learning:** Developed a repeatable workflow for calculated fields and filters that speeds up future Tableau projects.
- **Learning:** Learned to balance high-level KPIs with detailed drill-downs so dashboards remain clear yet powerful.
